# PYPAINT

PYPAINT Paint is a Desktop Application, developed in Python 3.
The application is developed by:
Ayush Sharma

The paint application designed by me lets you create anything on canvas (Drawing Area), and gives you option to choose between 2 types of Brushes and a Pencil.
You can also choose your favorite color from a pallet of 20 different static colors, and you can also further select more colors from custom color options.
You can also create shapes like a Circle, Rectangle, Rhombus, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon and a Star.
The text feature in our paint application is one of the coolest features that i have added.
Unlike MS Paint, we can add a shadow to your text in your desired font and, you can also change the color of the shadow.
The other features in PYPAINT are: 
Eraser, because you always want to make up to things that have gone wrong.
Changing of text properties like Bold, Italic, and Underline.
You can also change the width of boundaries of shapes, pencil, eraser and brushes.
Being a Python Programmer, I understand the need to save time, and the art of being lazy.
So I have included shortcuts to clear Canvas and to Undo, because one always wants option to Undo unwanted things.
It also provides you feature to save and open files from your disk and can also open images you want to draw on.
Now to get to know all the Features of PYPAINT Paint, all you have to do is start using it, because using it would be more fun than to read an Abstract about it.
